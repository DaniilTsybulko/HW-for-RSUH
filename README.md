**English Accents and Dialects**

---
### Chapter 1

**1. If English is not your native language, what causes you the greatest difficulty in understanding spoken British and Irish English?**
   - This question depends on your personal experience. Some common difficulties might include:
     - Differences in accents and pronunciation, which can make speech harder to understand.
     - The use of specific British vocabulary and idioms, which can differ from American English.
     - A fast speaking pace or non-standard pronunciation of vowels and consonants depending on the accent (e.g., Scottish, Welsh, or Northern Irish accents can be challenging to grasp).

**2. For another language that you know (possibly your own):**
   (a) Can you give examples of differences:
   - **in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary between people in different regions of a country?**
     - Example: In Russian, there are pronunciation and lexical differences between the Moscow and St. Petersburg accents. Also, dialects in various regions of Russia may have unique words and expressions.
   - **in pronunciation and vocabulary between people from different social classes?**
     - Example: In Russian, people from different social backgrounds might use different levels of vocabulary — from colloquial terms to professional and literary language.
   - **forms of language that are generally considered "incorrect"?**
     - Example: Colloquial speech or the use of slang is sometimes considered "incorrect" in formal speech.

   (b) **Is there a city or region whose accent or dialect is regarded as somehow inferior or superior?**
   - **Is there a city or region whose accent or dialect is regarded as somehow superior?**
     - Example: In some countries, the capital's accent may be considered the "standard" and viewed as more prestigious. In Russia, for example, the Moscow accent may be considered more "standard" compared to other regional dialects.
   - **On what basis are claims made for their inferiority or superiority? Do you think these claims are valid?**
     - This can be related to cultural or historical biases. It’s important to remember that no accent or dialect is inherently "better" than another, and such claims are often based on subjective opinions.

**3. Compare the language you have taken your examples from with British English.**
   - For example, in Britain, the capital’s London accent (RP - Received Pronunciation) can be perceived as "prestigious" compared to other regional accents (such as Cockney or Northern accents).

**4. What would your response be to the suggestion that the following are ‘wrong’ in some way?**
   - Some of these examples (e.g., *'tater* for *potato* or *I'm after seeing him only yesterday* for *I saw him only yesterday*) are characteristic of certain accents or dialects, like Irish or Cockney. They are not "wrong" — they are simply part of different dialects and variations of English.

### Chapter 2

1. Examples in non-standard English:
   - (a) Multiple negation with two negatives: *"I don’t know nothing."*
   - (b) Multiple negation with three negatives: *"I haven’t done nothing to nobody."*
   - (c) Another form of negation only in non-standard dialects: *"I ain’t going."* (use of *ain’t* as a negative form).
   - (d) Past tense and past participle with the same form: *"I seen him yesterday."*
   - (e) Present tense, past tense, and past participle with the same form: *"He come here yesterday."*

2. Where you are likely to hear native speakers in Britain saying:
   - (a) *"He smoke a lot"* – Non-standard dialects in certain urban areas, e.g., some Caribbean-influenced varieties in London.
   - (b) *"I likes it"* – West Country or Somerset.
   - (c) *"He do (duzuz) it all the time, do he?"* – South Wales.
   - (d) *"I’ve not had the chance"* – North England or Midlands.
   - (e) *"Where’s thine?"* – Yorkshire.
   - (f) *"Give it to we"* – South-West England (West Country).
   - (g) *"Where’s that pipe? Ah, there he is"* – South-West dialects.
   - (h) *"Does he not want to go?"* – Northern English or Scots English.
   - (i) *"He gave it the girl"* – Midlands or Northern England.
   - (j) *"It needs altered"* – Scottish or Northern English dialects.
   - (k) *"Give her that apples"* – South-West or non-standard rural areas.

3. RP Variability and Pronunciation:
   - Factors influencing RP variability include:
     - Social class and prestige differences.
     - Generational change (younger vs older speakers).
     - Regional influences and mobility.
     - Media exposure and globalization.
     - Ethnic and cultural background.
     - Style of speech (formal vs informal).

4. Glottal stop usage in RP:
   - In RP, the glottal stop is minimally used but increasing among younger speakers, especially in words like *butter* and *bottle*, pronounced as [ʔ] instead of [t].

5. Dropping of /h/ in RP:
   - Historically avoided in RP, /h/ is more likely to be dropped in casual speech or among less formal younger speakers.

6. RP Pronunciation of nasals in words like *cotton*:
   - In RP, the nasal is reduced, and the /t/ in words like *cotton* is often pronounced as a glottal stop or fully elided.

7. Linking and intrusive /r/:
   - Examples of linking /r/:
     - Across a word boundary: *"law and order"* → [lɔːr ən ˈɔːdə].
   - Examples of intrusive /r/:
     - Across a word boundary: *"the idea of it"* → [ðiː aɪˈdɪər əv ɪt].
     - Within a word: *"drawring"* instead of *drawing*.

8. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) *like university to have a vowel more like /i/ than /ɪ/.*
   - (b) *for /t/ to be replaced by /ʔ/.*
   - (c) *between /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ in words such as right and rout.*
   - (d) *pronounced with /ɔː/ are now pronounced with /ə/ by most speakers.*
   - (e) *to become /jə/.*
   
9. Smoothing and levelling in RP:
   - Smoothing refers to reducing diphthongs into monophthongs, such as /aɪə/ becoming /aː/ in *fire*.
   - Levelling refers to reducing distinct regional pronunciations to a common standard, such as vowel mergers.

### Chapter 3

1. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) *Clear [l] and dark [ɫ] are allophones of the same phoneme.*
   - (b) *use a clear [l] in place of dark [ɫ] in some environments.*
   - (c) *one more vowel distinction than other RP speakers.*
   - (d) *pronunciation of the word /r/ can be produced with or without [ʃ].*

2. Phoneme variability:
   - This refers to differences in how certain phonemes are realized, such as /r/ in rhotic vs non-rhotic accents.

3. Examples of non-standard word pronunciation:
   - Northern England uses /ʊ/ for /ʌ/ in *put*, making it sound closer to *putt*.

### Chapter 4

1. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) *do not distinguish vowel pairs of lock and lack*.
   - (b) *vowel /aɪ/ in both,* older speakers prefer /ʊ/ in *loch*.
   - (c) *pronounced with the vowel /ɪ/.*
   - (d) *exceptions to this are the l-vocalizations.*
   - (d) Post-vocalic /r/ survives in the South-West of England, central Scotland, and Ireland.
   - (e) Scottish speakers make no distinction between *pull* and *pool*, or between *cot* and *caught*.
   - (f) While /h/ is variably absent in most regional accents in England and Wales, it is retained in the North-West of England, including the city of Liverpool.

---

#### 2. Use of /ʔ/ in different parts of the British Isles:
   - The glottal stop /ʔ/ is commonly used in London, Estuary English, and Glasgow. For example, in words like *butter* ([ˈbʌʔə]) and *football* ([ˈfʊʔbɔːl]), /ʔ/ replaces /t/.

---

#### 3. Pronunciation of words spelled with <ng> in *singer* and *breaking*:
   - In accents like RP, *singer* is pronounced with [ŋ], while *breaking* retains a velar plosive [ŋɡ]. However, in some regional accents (e.g., Yorkshire or Midlands), both may include [ŋɡ].

---

#### 4. Where is the word *beautiful* pronounced without /j/?
   - In Northern England accents, the word *beautiful* may be pronounced without the glide /j/, resulting in [ˈbuːtəfʊl] rather than [ˈbjuːtəfʊl].
### Chapter 5

#### London

1. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) The consonant in the middle of the word *water* may be realized as [ʔ] (a glottal stop), rather than as [t].
   - (b) The initial sound in *thin* and the final sound in *breath* may be [f], rather than [θ].
   - (c) The second consonant in *bother* and the final consonant in *breathe* may be [v], rather than [ð].
   - (d) Initial /p, t, k/ are heavily aspirated.

2. Difference between the pronunciations of *pause* and *paws*:
   - In non-rhotic London accents, there is no distinction in the pronunciation of *pause* and *paws*; both are pronounced as [pɔːz].

3. Phonological environments in which /l/ is realized as a vowel:
   - /l/ is vocalized (replaced by a vowel-like sound) in syllable-final positions, as in *ball* or *milk*. This phenomenon is called *l-vocalization*.

---

#### Norwich

1. Noteworthy aspect of the pronunciation of the word *fear* in Norwich:
   - The word *fear* may be pronounced with a monophthong, sounding more like [fɪə] or [fæə], rather than the standard diphthong [fɪə].

2. Examples of homophones in Norwich speech distinct from RP:
   - Words like *do* and *dew* are pronounced the same, both as [duː].

3. Pronunciation of <-ing> in Norwich:
   - In Norwich speech, <-ing> is typically pronounced as [ɪn], rather than the standard RP [ɪŋ]. For example, *walking* would be pronounced as [ˈwɔːkɪn].

---

#### Bristol

1. What is the 'Bristol /l/'?
   - The 'Bristol /l/' refers to the addition of an /l/ sound at the end of words ending in a schwa, such as *area*, pronounced [ˈeəriəl].

2. Bristol pronunciation of the word *lard* compared to RP:
   - In Bristol, *lard* may have a more pronounced rhotic sound, and final schwa-like sounds may acquire an /l/ or a vowel closer to [ɒ].

3. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) There is no /æ/ – /ɑː/ contrast in Bristol speech. The pronunciation of *half* and *hat* illustrates this.
   - (b) The vowel in the word *cup* is /ʌ/. In Bristol, there seems not to be a /ʌ/ – /ɪ/ contrast.

---

#### South Wales

1. Differences between RP and South Wales accents for /l/:
   - In South Wales, /l/ tends to be clear [l] in all positions, unlike RP, where it is dark [ɫ] in syllable-final positions.

2. Fill in the gaps:
   - (a) The vowels in words like *bird* exhibit monophthongization, pronounced closer to [bɜːd].
   - (b) Between vowels, when the first vowel is stressed, consonants may be geminated (doubled), e.g., *ladder* pronounced as [ˈlædːə].
   - (c) /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ are distributed largely as in the north of England, but are normally distinguished by vowel length alone.

3. Influence of Welsh on English in South Wales:
   - Intonation patterns are influenced by Welsh, with a characteristic rise-fall pattern.
   - Vowel durations are often longer, influenced by the phonological systems of Welsh.

---

#### West Midlands

1. Accent classification as northern or southern:
   - The West Midlands accent can be classified as *northern* due to its use of short /a/ in words like *bath*. It resembles *southern* accents in its use of non-rhoticity and other vowel features.

2. The vowel in the word *one*:
   - The vowel in *one* is pronounced as /ʊ/, making it sound closer to [wʊn].

3. West Midlands pronunciations of words on a vowel quadrilateral:
   - *hat* – [hæ].
   - *hit* – [hɪ].
   - *hut* – [hʊ].
   - *hot* – [hɒ].
   - *hoot* – [huː].

---

#### Leicester

1. Key differences between East Midlands and West Midlands accents:
   - East Midlands accents tend to merge /ʌ/ and /ɒ/ into a single vowel [ʊ].
   - West Midlands accents retain a distinction between these vowels.

2. Homophones in Leicester accent distinct from RP:
   - Words like *four* and *for* are pronounced the same, as [fɔː].
